<p>Goodnight Journal is practical and intuitive, which makes your journal more enjoyable. However, what makes Goodnight Journal different from other online journals is its community. In it, you can share your good or bad feelings and exchange ideas with people who, many times, have been through the same situation as you.

<p>
Another positive point of the application is its interface. No matter what system you use, IOS, Android, or any other type of system. The interface is always the same.
If you like to keep simple and join a great community, Goodnight Journal is the best app for you.</p>

<h2 id="momento">Momento</h2>
<p>Diaro is a popular journal site among journal users. It is also available in the app version that can be used on both Android and iOS devices. Diaro helps you to organize your entries using folders and tags. You can easily access those entries later by simply searching for the keywords that you used in your entry. The paid version of Diaro comes with back-up options that will help you to restore your data anytime. The entries can also be converted into PDF format if you want them printed.</p>

<h2 id="penzu">Penzu</h2>
<p>Momento is often called the "smart private journal app". It gets its name for a reason. This smart app allows you to connect it to most of your social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Whatever you do on your social media on a particular day, it automatically adds it to your journal entry for that day. Besides this cool feature, you can always add your manual entries with photos, videos, and whatsoever to treasure your beautiful moments. It's disappointing to say that this amazing app is only available for Apple iOS devices.

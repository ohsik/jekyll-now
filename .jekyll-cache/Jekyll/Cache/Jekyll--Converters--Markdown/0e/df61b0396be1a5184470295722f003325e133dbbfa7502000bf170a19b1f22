<h2 id="momento">Momento</h2>
<p>Momento is often called the "smart private journal app". It gets its name for a reason. This smart app allows you to connect it to most of your social media accounts such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. Whatever you do on your social media on a particular day, it automatically adds it to your journal entry for that day. Besides this cool feature, you can always add your manual entries with photos, videos, and whatsoever to treasure your beautiful moments. It's disappointing to say that this amazing app is only available for Apple iOS devices.

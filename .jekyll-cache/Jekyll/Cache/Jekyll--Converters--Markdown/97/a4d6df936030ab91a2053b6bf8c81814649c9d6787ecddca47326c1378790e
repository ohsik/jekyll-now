I"§<p>Today I feel stronger, even though I am sometimes fragile inside. I thought a lot of things today. Most of the time I like to walk, put on the headphones, and feel the feeling of freedom in my soul. It's time for me to reflect and think about many things that have happened to me. Some I even smile a little silly in the middle of the street. Others I move away and leave once more forgotten in some drawer of time.</p>
